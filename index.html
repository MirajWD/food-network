            <h3>Oat Milk</h3>
            <p>Just make sure you are using unsweetened oat milk and a brand with a neutral flavor. Use oat milk to add
                a touch of creaminess to soups like cream of mushroom or butternut squash soup.</p>

            <h3>Chicken & Spinach Soup</h3>
            <p>This fragrant, Italian-flavored soup takes advantage of quick-cooking ingredients--boneless, skinless
                chicken breast, bagged baby spinach and canned beans. It features a simple homemade basil pesto swirled
                in at the end to add a fresh herb flavor.</p>

            <h3>Creamy Mashed Cauliflower</h3>
            <p>This creamy cauliflower mash makes a perfect low-carb stand-in for mashed potatoes. Here we take simple
                mashed cauliflower and mix in garlic, buttermilk and a touch of butter to create a flavorful side dish
                that has about one-quarter of the calories of typical mashed potatoes.</p>
